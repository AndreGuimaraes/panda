Hi,

Welcome to the Panda beta!

You can sign up for your account at: http://hq.pandastream.com/signup (make sure you use the same email that this invite was sent to)

Once you have your login details you'll probably want to have a read through the Getting started (using Ruby on Rails) guide here: http://pandastream.com/docs/getting_started

If you're interested in getting to know the API in more depth, the docs are here: http://pandastream.com/docs

During the beta period we won't be charging for use, however videos will be cut to 3 minutes and removed after 1 week. If you would like to use Panda in production please get in contact (panda@new-bamboo.co.uk) with us!

Thanks,
Team Panda.
