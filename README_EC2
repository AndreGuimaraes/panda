Panda on EC2
============

Launch the AMI
--------------
ec2-run-instances ami-5538dd3c -k pv-keypair

cd /usr/local/panda
git clone git@github.com:newbamboo/panda.git

Create buckets, domains and queues
----------------------------------

You'll need two S3 buckets, one encoded videos (tip: name this a domain such videos.pandastream.com and you can setup a CNAME to S3) another to keep the raw video files in (currently saved with private access only)
